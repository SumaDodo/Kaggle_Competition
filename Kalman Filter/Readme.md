**How Kalman Filter Works?**

- It is a general and powerful tool for combining information in the presence of uncertaininty.

Kalman filter is basically to make an educated guess about any dynamic system. Kalman filter does a very good job filtering out all the
messy reality that comes along. It can take advantage of the corelations between crazy phenomena concerning the data a hand. But it's 
important to note that Kalman filter is really good and ideal for systems that are changing continuously as that would require very less
memory [ Just the previous state]. All that is needed to understand the concept of Kalman Filter is Probability and matrices.
