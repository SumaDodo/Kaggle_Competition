Introduction -

Large Hadron Collider (LHC) located at CERN headquarters is a large machine that splits particles into smaller and smaller components to 
identify elementary particles from which all matter and energy is derived. It propels sub-atomic particles called hadrons at high speed. 
This particle accelarator is also called as "Atom Smasher" in layman terms.
